This is the application we made for the Inutit Smallbiz hackathon 2018 with 2 other team members. I was in change of creating the template mobile application which would then be combined with the API's to be used with it.

Our idea was to create an Inventory management system. It would notify the user's with a pop-up message if there were any change in stock that were outside of the normal trend. If there were big change's this would classify as an emergency and a automated phone call would ring the person to notify them.

Integrated the functionality for the application to use the Nexmo API which would make the call:<br/>

Quickbooks API was used to track the inventory:<br/>
